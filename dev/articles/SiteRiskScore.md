# Calculating Site Risk Scores

## Overview

This vignette describes how **site-level risk scores** are calculated
using Key Risk Indicators (KRIs), their associated *flags*, and
predefined *weights* for those flags. The risk scoring framework
provides a standardized, quantitative way to highlight sites with
elevated risk.

## Risk Indicators, Flags and Weights

Each KRI (e.g., Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, Protocol
Deviations) in the `gsm` framework is assigned a *flag* as part of the
[standard analysis
workflow](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/gsm.core/articles/DataAnalysis.html).
Flags can also be associated with a *weight*, which reflects their
contribution to site risk. For example, a site with a low adverse event
rate could present more risk than a site with a low query rate. While
both KRIs could have the same `flag` value (e.g. -2, representing low
rates compared to other sites) a higher *weight* could be assigned to
the AE KRI flag than the query rate KRI flag. Default flag weights for
the 12 standard `gsm` are shown below.

| KRI                           | Low_Red | Low_Amber | High_Amber | High_Red |
|:------------------------------|--------:|----------:|-----------:|---------:|
| Adverse Event                 |      32 |        16 |          1 |        2 |
| Serious Adverse Event         |       8 |         0 |          4 |        8 |
| Protocol Deviations           |       8 |         4 |          8 |       16 |
| Important Protocol Deviations |       0 |         0 |         16 |       32 |
| Labs                          |       0 |         0 |          1 |        2 |
| Query Rate                    |       0 |         0 |          1 |        2 |
| Delayed Query Rate            |       0 |         0 |          1 |        2 |
| Delayed Data Entry Rate       |       0 |         0 |          1 |        2 |
| Data Change Rate              |       0 |         0 |          1 |        2 |
| Screen Failure                |       0 |         0 |          8 |       16 |
| Treatment Discontinuation     |       0 |         0 |         16 |       32 |
| Study Discontinuation         |       0 |         0 |         16 |       32 |

Flag Weights for Key Risk Indicators

The `gsm.core::flag()` function is used to calculate site-level flag
values and associated weights. Three key parameters are used in the
site-risk score process:

- `vThreshold` Vector of numeric values representing threshold values.
  Default is `c(-3,-2,2,3)` which is typical for z-scores.
- `vFlag` Vector of flag values. There must be one more item in Flag
  than thresholds - that is
  `length(vThreshold)+1 == length(vFlagValues)`. Default is
  `c(-2,-1,0,1,2)`, which is typical for z-scores.
- `vRiskScoreWeight` Vector of weights to apply to each flag value.
  Default: `NULL`.

When `vRiskScoreWeight` is provided, the
[`Flag()`](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/gsm.core/reference/Flag.html)
output will include additional columns capturing `Weight` and
`MaxWeight` with the corresponding weight for each KRI.

These parameters allow for flexible configuration of the relative risk
for different metrics in a study. While single metrics can be run via
direct calls to
[`Flag()`](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/gsm.core/reference/Flag.html),
[YAML workflows are recommended for reusable
implementations](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/gsm.kri/articles/AddingKRIs.html).
As such, all standard KRIs include default thresholds, flags and
weights. For reference, the relevant sections of the [Adverse Event KRI
YAML](https://github.com/Gilead-BioStats/gsm.kri/blob/main/inst/workflow/2_metrics/kri0001.yaml),
including the default flag and weight values and
[`Flag()`](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/gsm.core/reference/Flag.html)
function call are shown below for reference:

    meta:
      Type: Analysis
      ID: kri0001
      GroupLevel: Site
      Abbreviation: AE
      Metric: Adverse Event Rate
      Numerator: Adverse Events
      Denominator: Days on Study
      Model: Normal Approximation
      Score: Adjusted Z-Score
      AnalysisType: rate
      Threshold: -2,-1,2,3
      Flag: "-2,-1,0,1,2"
      RiskScoreWeight: "32,16,0,1,2"
      ...
    steps:
      - output: vThreshold
        name: gsm.core::ParseThreshold
        params:
          strThreshold: Threshold
      - output: vRiskScoreWeight
        name: gsm.core::ParseThreshold
        params:
          strThreshold: RiskScoreWeight
          bSort: false
      - output: vFlag
        name: gsm.core::ParseThreshold
        params:
          strThreshold: Flag
          bSort: false
      ... 
      - output: Analysis_Flagged
        name: gsm.core::Flag
        params:
          dfAnalyzed: Analysis_Analyzed
          vThreshold: vThreshold
          vFlag: vFlag
          vRiskScoreWeight: vRiskScoreWeight
          nAccrualThreshold: AccrualThreshold
          strAccrualMetric: AccrualMetric
      ...

First, `Threshold`, `Flag`, and `RiskScoreWeight` values provided in the
metadata are parsed from strings to vectors using
[`gsm.core::ParseThreshold()`](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/gsm.core/reference/ParseThreshold.html).
These parsed vectors are then passed to the
[`gsm.core::Flag()`](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/gsm.core/reference/Flag.html)
function to compute flags and weights for each site.

## Site Risk Score Calculation

Once all flagsd and weights for all metrics are calculated, a **site
risk score** is calculated by taking the sum of the weights associated
for each KRI. Below is a worked example for one site:

| KRI                           | Flag | Contribution |
|:------------------------------|-----:|-------------:|
| Adverse Event                 |   -2 |           32 |
| Serious Adverse Event         |    0 |            0 |
| Protocol Deviations           |   -1 |            4 |
| Important Protocol Deviations |    0 |            0 |
| Labs                          |    0 |            0 |
| Query Rate                    |    1 |            1 |
| Delayed Query Rate            |    0 |            0 |
| Delayed Data Entry Rate       |    0 |            0 |
| Data Change Rate              |    0 |            0 |
| Screen Failure                |    1 |            8 |
| Treatment Discontinuation     |    0 |            0 |
| Study Discontinuation         |    0 |            0 |

Example Site Contributions to Risk Score

These weights are added up at the site level and divided by the maximum
possible score to create a **normalized risk score** between 0 and 100.
This normalized site risk score is what is reported in the KRI report,
and if desired, any sites above a certain threshold can be flagged for
further review.

``` r
normalized_score <- (sum(site_example$Contribution)/178) * 100
normalized_score
#> [1] 25.2809
```

### Using CalculateRiskScore()

The
[`gsm.kri::CalculateRiskScore()`](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/gsm.kri/dev/reference/CalculateRiskScore.md)
function simplifies the risk score calculation process. The function
takes KRI results with flag information and a weights table to compute
normalized risk scores automatically.

#### Basic Usage

``` r
library(gsm.core)
library(gsm.kri)
library(dplyr)

# Step 1: Prepare KRI results (filter to single study/snapshot)
dfResults <- gsm.core::reportingResults %>%
  filter(!grepl("srs0001", MetricID)) %>%
  FilterByLatestSnapshotDate()

# Step 2: Create weights table from metric metadata
dfWeights <- MakeWeights(gsm.core::reportingMetrics)

# Step 3: Calculate risk scores
dfRiskScore <- CalculateRiskScore(
  dfResults = dfResults,
  dfWeights = dfWeights,
  strMetricID = "Analysis_srs0001"
)
```

The
[`MakeWeights()`](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/gsm.kri/dev/reference/MakeWeights.md)
function parses the `Flag` and `RiskScoreWeight` columns from the
metrics metadata (e.g.,
[`gsm.core::reportingMetrics`](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/gsm.core/reference/reportingMetrics.html))
to create a weight lookup table. This table contains one row per
MetricID-Flag combination with corresponding weights and maximum
weights.

#### Default Workflow

The Site Risk Score is calculated automatically as part of the standard
KRI workflow using the `srs0001.yaml` workflow file located in
`inst/workflow/2_metrics/`. This workflow:

1.  Filters the list of analyzed KRIs to only include those with the
    “kri” pattern
2.  Stacks the flagged results from all KRIs into a single data frame
3.  Calls
    [`CalculateRiskScore()`](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/gsm.kri/dev/reference/CalculateRiskScore.md)
    to compute site risk scores
4.  Returns the results as a new metric (`srs0001`) using the
    [`gsm.kri::CalculateRiskScore()`](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/gsm.kri/dev/reference/CalculateRiskScore.md)
    function
5.  The standard KRI report produced by
    [`Report_KRI()`](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/gsm.kri/dev/reference/Report_KRI.md)
    includes a column showing the normalized site risk score for each
    site for a single study.

## Cross-Study Site Risk Scores

The
[`Widget_CrossStudyRiskScore()`](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/gsm.kri/dev/reference/Widget_CrossStudyRiskScore.md)
function enables visualization of site risk scores across multiple
studies simultaneously. This widget provides an interactive table that
allows users to:

- View aggregated risk score statistics across studies
- Compare site performance within and across studies
- Drill down into individual site details by clicking on summary rows

### Cross-Study Implementation

The cross-study widget requires results data that includes the
`Analysis_srs0001` metric along with individual KRI results. The
workflow typically involves:

1.  **Data preparation**: Combine results from multiple studies,
    ensuring each has calculated site risk scores
2.  **Summary generation**: Use
    [`SummarizeCrossStudy()`](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/gsm.kri/dev/reference/SummarizeCrossStudy.md)
    to aggregate metrics across studies
3.  **Widget creation**: Pass results, metrics, and groups metadata to
    create the interactive visualization

``` r
# Example: Create cross-study risk score widget
cross_study_widget <- Widget_CrossStudyRiskScore(
  dfResults = multi_study_results,  # Must include Analysis_srs0001
  dfMetrics = gsm.core::reportingMetrics,
  dfGroups = multi_study_groups,
  strGroupLevel = "Site"
)
```

The widget produces an interactive table showing risk score summaries
across studies:

multiple studies](figures/CrossStudySRS.png)

multiple studies

For a complete working example, see
`inst/examples/Example_CrossStudySRS.Rmd`, which demonstrates:

- Simulating multi-study data with site risk scores
- Creating the cross-study widget
- Rendering the interactive visualization in an HTML report

This functionality is particularly useful for portfolio-level monitoring
where sponsors need to assess relative risk across multiple clinical
trials simultaneously.

## Conclusion

This scoring framework provides an interpretable, quantitative measure
of risk at each site. By combining information across KRIs and weighting
severity appropriately, it allows data monitoring teams to identify
high-risk sites and prioritize monitoring resources effectively.
