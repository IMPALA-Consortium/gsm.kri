# Changelog

## gsm.kri 1.3.2

This patch release addresses a bug that was impacting the country-level
KRI report.

## gsm.kri 1.3.1

This patch release addresses a bug related to the `gsm.viz`
implementation of site risk score.

## gsm.kri 1.3.0

This release adds a new Site Risk Score metric that calculates weighted
site-level risk across multiple KRIs. In short, the new default workflow
has the following steps:

- KRI Flags are given weights using the new `RiskScoreWeight` parameter
  in the `yaml` workflows for each KRI.
- Site-level risk scores are calculated using the new
  [`CalculateRiskScore()`](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/gsm.kri/dev/reference/CalculateRiskScore.md)
  function.
- Site Risk Scores are saved in a new Metric `srs0001` via a new
  standard workflow
- A column showing site risk scores has been added to the KRI report via
  update in `gsm.viz`

See the new Site Risk Score vignette for full implementation details.
Other minor updates are described below.

  attribute

  each yaml.
